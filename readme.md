This is series of exercises for improving my developer skills.

From now on, I will be working from my local setup, and git it here more often. Just to get familiar with all of this stuff.

So, now I am on Section 7 - Lecture 83 of Colt Steele's The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.
You can find overview of bootcamp over here: https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/
I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be a full-stack developer.

My goal is finishing this course by the first day of February. I am going to make portfolio site and 3 project for it. Edit: _Couldn't make it._

_Life happens_ and we should endure it. New plan is finishing bootcamp course in this month and launch personal site as well. _Due Date: 01 May 2018_
